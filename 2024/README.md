## About this project

The main objective is to obtain as many stars as possible, I will try to get at least 25 stars.

This year puzzles will be solved using python 3.12, each puzzle will be an independent project following the next structure:
- `dayX`: X goes from 1 to 25
  - `src`
    - `data`: containing the input data file
    - `main.py`: contains the functions that solve the puzzle
    - `xxxx.py`: Other scripts that may be needed
    - `tests`: test files
      - `data`: test inputs
      - `test_xxxx.py`: contains test cases.
